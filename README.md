## How it works

A polar-limited [PhysBone](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/physbones) creates an offset for a [Contact](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/contacts) system to play animations when a slashing motion is done with your arm. A networking layer animates a separate PhysBone hierarchy to account for "IK Smoothing".

## Install guide

* [Cancerspace shader](https://github.com/AkaiMage/VRC-Cancerspace) is required for the default effect.
* Merge the Animator Controller ``Weapon Slash FX`` to your own FX Controller, using the [Avatars 3.0 Manager](https://github.com/VRLabs/Avatars-3.0-Manager) tool.
* Drag & drop the ``Weapon Slash FX`` prefab into the base of your Hierarchy.
* Right click and unpack the prefab, then drag & drop it onto your avatar.
* ``WeaponSlash.Sync`` is a synced parameter, so click the checkbox within the tool to add it to your avatar's parameter asset.
* Locate ``Weapon Slash/Weapon``.
  * You can replace ``Weapon Slash/Weapon/„Ç≠„É•„Éº„Éñ„ÇΩ„Éº„Éâ`` with your own prop. Keep your prop in the same placement and facing the same way as the default prop.
* Put ``Weapon Slash/Weapon`` under your avatar's wrist. Set the ``Weapon`` object transforms so the prop appears correctly in your hand.

## How to use

* ``WeaponSlash.Control`` parameter must be True for the system to be active.
* ``WeaponSlash.Heavy.Active`` parameter must be True for the Heavy Slash to be enabled.
* Use the parameter driver to set the ``WeaponSlash.Heavy.Active`` to True in your dominant hand gesture layer. Set the value to False on other gestures within that layer. Holding the value at True will enable the Strong Heavy Slash effect.
* Under the ``Weapon Slash/Effects/(Light or Heavy) Slash`` hierarchy are Containers. Place custom effects within these Containers. ``Weapon/(Light or Heavy) Effect Target`` is where these effects will appear.

You can edit ``Weapon Slash/Dynamics/PhysBone`` to change the force required for the slash. For further adjustment you can also change the radius of ``Weapon Slash/Dynamics/Receiver``.
