## How it works

* A polar-limited [PhysBone](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/physbones) creates an offset for a [Contact](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/contacts) system to play animations when a slashing motion is done with your arm.
* A networking layer animates a separate PhysBone hierarchy to account for [IK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_kinematics) smoothing.

## Install guide


https://github.com/VRLabs/Weapon-Slash/assets/76777936/129c37e9-101d-4a30-854e-00c03a01016c

* Download and import [Cancerspace shader](https://github.com/AkaiMage/VRC-Cancerspace).
* Merge the Animator Controller ``Weapon Slash FX`` to your own FX Controller, using the [Avatars 3.0 Manager](https://github.com/VRLabs/Avatars-3.0-Manager) tool.
* Merge the Expression Parameter List``Weapon Slash Expressions```to your own Expression Parameter List, using the [Avatars 3.0 Manager](https://github.com/VRLabs/Avatars-3.0-Manager) tool.
* Drag & drop the ``Weapon Slash`` prefab into the base of your Hierarchy.
* Right click and unpack the prefab, then drag & drop it onto your avatar.
* Expand the prefab hierarchy and find ``Weapon Slash`` -> ``Weapon``
* Move ``Weapon`` outside of ``Weapon Slash`` and place it on the left or right wrist of your avatar.
  * Adjust the position and rotation of ``Weapon`` to fit into your hand.
  * You can replace ``Weapon`` -> ``„Ç≠„É•„Éº„Éñ„ÇΩ„Éº„Éâ`` with your own prop. Keep your prop in the same placement and facing the same way as the default prop.

## How to use

* ``WeaponSlash/Control`` parameter must be True for the system to be active.
* ``WeaponSlash/HeavyActive`` parameter must be True for the Heavy Slash to be enabled.
* Under the ``Weapon Slash/Effects/(Light or Heavy) Slash`` hierarchy are Containers. Place custom effects within these Containers. ``Weapon/(Light or Heavy) Effect Target`` is where these effects will appear.
* You can edit ``Weapon Slash/Dynamics/PhysBone`` to change the force required for the slash. For further adjustment you can also change the radius of ``Weapon Slash/Dynamics/Receiver``.
